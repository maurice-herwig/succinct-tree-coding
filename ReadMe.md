# Succinct Tree Coding

Implementation of a succinct tree coding for an ordered tree by using the method of Jurdzinski and Lazic published in [Succinct progress measures for solving parity games](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8005092).
    
A succinct tree coding maps every leave of an ordered tree of height h and with at most l leaves  to a $`\lceil (log_2 l) \rceil`$ -bounded adaptive $`i`$-counter.
